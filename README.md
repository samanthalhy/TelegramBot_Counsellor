# TelegramBot_Counsellor

This telegram bot provide a virtual counsellor to listen to you. It can detect your sentiment and give an approriate response like a real counsellor. 
For example, if you are sad, it can show support and provide some useful suggestion to comfort you.

This counsellor is developed based on the `text-davinci-003`. We apply the prompting technique to create a counsellor character image.
